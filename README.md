A blockchain is a continuously growing set of records that are linked to each other using cryptography and consensus algorithms. 
It is a distributed ledger in a digital format that contains the information of all the events or transactions that have taken place in the network.
This information is shared among the network members also called the nodes. Blockchain is a peer to peer network. 
Blockchain was introduced as a backbone of the crypto currency “Bitcoin”. 
Satoshi Nakamoto, an individual or a group of people published the first paper on Bitcoin as a “pure peer to peer network” in the year 2008. 
Considering Bitcoin as a base example of Blockchain, let's understand how this works. Bitcoin can be used to exchange digital assets online.
